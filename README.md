# Happiness Index Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the World Happiness Index from 2015 to 2019 using Python's data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas. The dataset includes various factors such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom, and perception of corruption, among others.

## Data Preparation
- Five CSV files were loaded into Pandas DataFrames, each representing the Happiness Index for a specific year from 2015 to 2019.
- Column names were standardized across all years for consistency in analysis.
- Unnecessary columns were dropped from the datasets.
- Data cleaning steps were performed to handle missing values and inconsistencies in country names.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for the presence of countries and regions in the dataset.
- Replaced outdated or inconsistent country names with their correct versions.
- Explored the distribution of Happiness Scores by region through box plots and bar plots.
- Analyzed the trend of average Happiness Scores over the years.

## Insights
- Identified the top 10 happiest countries and top 10 most sad countries for each year.
- Detected anomalies where countries entered the top 10 happiest list in consecutive years.
- Visualized correlations between happiness scores and key factors like GDP per capita and life expectancy.

## Geographic Analysis
- Mapped the Happiness Scores across the world using a choropleth map.
- Explored relationships between GDP per capita, life expectancy, and happiness using scatter plots and bubble charts.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the factors influencing happiness levels globally over the years. By understanding these factors, policymakers and organizations can work towards enhancing happiness and well-being in different regions.
